<h1>MINECRAFT</h1>
<p>My favourite computer game is Minecraft. It is an indie game. This game was released in 2011. In spite of pixel graphics the game is very interesting and exciting! In this game you can build your own house or a castle. Also, it is possible for you to dig holes. Roughly speaking, in this game you can do everything.

The game is played over a million players around the world! I recommend this game to people who enjoy choosing actions in the game.</p>
